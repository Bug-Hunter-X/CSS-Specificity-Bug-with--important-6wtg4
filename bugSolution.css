The solution involves refactoring the CSS to avoid using `!important` and leverage the natural specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

By removing the `!important` declaration and ensuring the selectors are structured correctly, we can utilize the natural specificity of CSS to achieve the desired styling without resorting to `!important`, which is often considered bad practice due to its overriding behavior and debugging complications.
