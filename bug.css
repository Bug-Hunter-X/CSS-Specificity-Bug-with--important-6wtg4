The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon bug related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

In this example, we might expect the `.parent .child` selector to override the `!important` declaration in `.child` due to its higher specificity. However, this is not the case. The `!important` declaration prevails, resulting in the text within the `.child` element being red.

This happens because the `!important` declaration essentially bypasses the normal CSS specificity rules.

This bug can be particularly tricky to debug because it is not readily apparent from the structure of the CSS code.
